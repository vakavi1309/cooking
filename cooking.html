		<i><b><p class="dd">A dosa (also dosai or dosha or Dose) is a thin pancake or crepe, originating from South India, made from a fermented batter predominantly consisting of lentils and rice. It is somewhat similar to a crepe in appearance, although savoury flavours are generally emphasized (sweet variants also exist). Its main ingredients are rice and black gram, ground together in a fine, smooth batter with a dash of salt, then fermented. Dosas are a common dish in South Indian cuisine, but now have become popular all over the Indian subcontinent. Dosas are served hot along with chutney by tradition and sambar in recent times. Other accompaniments include chutney powder (a fine groundnut and lentil powder).</p></b></i>

		<i><b><p class="ii">A precursor of the modern idli is mentioned in several ancient Indian works. Vaddaradhane, a 920 CE Kannada language work by Shivakotiacharya mentions "iddalige", prepared only from a black gram batter. Chavundaraya II, the author of the earliest available Kannada encyclopedia, Lokopakara (c. 1025 CE), describes the preparation of this food by soaking black gram in buttermilk, ground to a fine paste, and mixed with the clear water of curd and spices.[1] The Western Chalukya king and scholar Someshwara III, reigning in the area now called Karnataka, included an idli recipe in his encyclopedia, Manasollasa (1130 CE). This Sanskrit-language work describes the food as iḍḍarikā. In Karnataka, the Idli in 1235 CE is described as being 'light, like coins of high value', which is not suggestive of a rice base.[2] The food prepared using this recipe is now called uddina idli in Karnataka.</p></b></i>

		<i><b><p class="pp">Puris are prepared with wheat flour, either atta (whole wheat flour) or sooji (coarse wheat flour). In some recipes, ajwain, cumin seed, spinach, or fenugreek seeds are added to the dough. The dough is either rolled out in a small circle or rolled out and cut out in small circles, then deep fried in ghee or vegetable oil. While deep frying, puris puff up like a round ball because moisture in the dough changes into steam which expands in all directions. When they are golden-brown in color, they are removed and either served hot or saved for later use (as with the snack food pani puri). Rolled puris may be pricked with a fork before deep frying to make flat puris for chaat like bhel puri. A punctured puri does not puff when cooked because the steam escapes as it cooks.</p></b></i>

		<i><b><p class="cc">Chapati dough is typically prepared with flour, salt and water, kneaded with the knuckles of the hand made into a fist and left to proof for at least 10 or 15 minutes to an hour for the gluten in the dough to develop. After proofing, the dough becomes softer and more pliable. Small portions of the dough are pinched off and formed into round balls that are pressed between the two palms to form discs which are then dipped into flour and rolled out on a circular rolling board (a chakla), using a rolling pin known as a velan or belan, into a flat disc.[7] There are also automatic roti makers which automate the whole process.[8]</p></b></i>

In Indonesia it can be found in several parts of Sumatra; especially the Malay regions of Riau, Riau Islands and Medan.[8] Nasi lemak can also be found in the Bangsamoro region of Mindanao, prepared by Filipino Moros, as well as Australia's external territories of Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands.

		<i><b><p class="dd">When foods were rationed in the US during World War II, bakers used boiled beetroot juices to enhance the color of their cakes. Beetroot is found in some red velvet cake recipes. Beetroot was and is used in some recipes as a filler or to retain moisture.[6] Adams Extract, a Texan company, is credited with bringing the red velvet cake to kitchens across America during the Great Depression era, by being one of the first to sell red food coloring and other flavor extracts with the use of point-of-sale posters and tear-off recipe cards.[7][8] The cake and its original recipe are well known in the United States from New York City's famous Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, which has dubbed the confection Waldorf-Astoria cake. However, it is widely considered a Southern recipe.[9] Traditionally, red velvet cake is iced with a French-style butter roux icing (also called ermine icing), which is very light and fluffy, but time-consuming to prepare. Cream cheese frosting and buttercream frosting are variations which have increased in popularity.[10][11]</p></b></i>

		<i><b><p class="ii">The egg tart started being sold in the early 20th century in Guangzhou (Canton), Guangdong province, inspired by the English custard tart. Guangzhou's status as the only port accessible to foreign traders led to the development of Cantonese cuisine having many outside influences.[1] As Guangzhou's economy grew from trade and interaction with Britain, pastry chefs at the Western-style department stores in the city were asked to invent new pastries weekly to attract customers from competitors. The egg tart, featuring a lard-based puff pastry crust and a filling similar to steamed egg pudding (燉蛋), was invented by a department store for one of these "Weekly Special" competitions.[2] The Zhen Guang Restaurant in Guangzhou is also credited with inventing the Chinese egg tart.[2] As Macau was a Portuguese colony, Macau-style egg tarts are a variation of the pastel de nata but they have been influenced by Guangzhou-style egg tarts.</p></b></i>

		<i><b><p class="pp">Chocolate cake is made with chocolate. It can also include other ingredients.[1] These include fudge, vanilla creme, and other sweeteners. The history of chocolate cake goes back to the 17th century, when cocoa powder from the Americas were added to traditional cake recipes.[2] In 1828, Coenraad van Houten of the Netherlands developed a mechanical extraction method for extracting the fat from cacao liquor resulting in cacao butter and the partly defatted cacao, a compacted mass of solids that could be sold as it was "rock cacao" or ground into powder.[3] The processes transformed chocolate from an exclusive luxury to an inexpensive daily snack.[3] A process for making silkier and smoother chocolate called conching was developed in 1879 by Rodolphe Lindt and made it easier to bake with chocolate, as it amalgamates smoothly and completely with cake batters.[3] Until 1890 to 1900, chocolate recipes were mostly for chocolate drinks,[3] and its presence in cakes was only in fillings and glazes.[4] In 1886, American cooks began adding chocolate to the cake batter, to make the first chocolate cakes in the US.[4]</p></b></i>
